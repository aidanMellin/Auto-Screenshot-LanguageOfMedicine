# Language of Medicine Automatic Screenshot grabber.

## Some background
This was a fully online class in which I had to study a series of powerpoint slides available only on a proprietary website in which staying AFK for
too long would result in one getting kicked from the session and having to re-authenticate (<-- this was a massive pain).

## My Goal
Use a combination of selenium and python to auomatically screenshot every slide and store to specific locations such that I can study the slides at my
own pace.

## The result
It worked! I left some manual sections (such as having to manually point to directories), and didn't include in OCR to read titles of each slide to 
change the name of the file being saved for easier studying, but I was happy with my end result.

### Metrics
Total time spent developing - ~ 5 hours
Total time debugging - 1.5 hours
Total time saved from this - Math.Infinity
